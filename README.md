# 🚗 Q-Learning Surge Pricing Model

## 🧠 Objective
Develop a **Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)** model for dynamic surge pricing to maximize profitability while maintaining customer satisfaction.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, OR-Tools, Power BI

## 🚀 Key Steps
- Simulated dynamic demand–supply environments  
- Designed a **Q-Learning agent** to determine optimal pricing actions  
- Compared results with deterministic optimization and MILP approaches  
- Visualized performance metrics and revenue outcomes in **Power BI**  
- Conducted sensitivity analysis to evaluate robustness under uncertainty

## 📈 Results
- RL model outperformed static pricing by **~12% in average profit**  
- Improved adaptability to demand fluctuations and reduced revenue volatility  
- Showed convergence of Q-values within 150 training episodes

## 🧩 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MehjabinTattu/Q-Learning-Surge-Pricing.git
